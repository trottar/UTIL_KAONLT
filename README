========================== Useful Info =================================================

You need to make various symbolic links for your replay scripts to function correctly. 
As mentioned in the README for the group directory, you should not store large files of ANY 
kind under /group/c-kaonlt/.

Your sym links should point to /volatile... unless you want the data to be backed up!
We have a group directory in /volatile, /volatile/hallc/c-kaonlt/.
You should make your own repository within this, e.g.

/volatile/hallc/c-kaonlt/USER/

Within this you will need the following folders and corresponding symbolic links in your
hallc_replay directory -

ROOTfiles
HISTOGRAMS
OUTPUT
REPORT_OUTPUT

Some of these require sub directories such as /COIN/PRODUCTION/ e.t.c unless you change your
templates.

Note you also need either /raw or /cache pointing to -

/cache/hallc/spring17/raw/

This is where raw data files are cached when they are taken from tape in the batch replay script.
See the batch template script in /UTIL_KAONLT/batch for more.

I will update this with more info on how to write directly to tape when it becomes relevant.
